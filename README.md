# Example: Monorepo

This example repo serves as a companion to the Inngest guide: [Trigger your code from Retool](https://inngest.com/docs/guides/trigger-your-code-from-retool). This is a basic example that shows you how you can:

1. Re-use existing code with an Inngest function in a monorepo
2. Use a custom Dockerfile with your Inngest function.
3. Handle a `retool/backfill.requested` event with your code
